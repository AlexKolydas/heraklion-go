For my final year university thesis I programmed an augmented-reality Android game. The application's concept is that of a real-time game where you roam around a city (Heraklion in this case) and in specified points in the map you can solve challenges in order to advance in the game. 

The application consists of a number of parts. The mobile application is programmed in Unity3D in order to provide all of the AR features to the user. A PHP backend using CodeIgniter provides the application's state, content and user management.
